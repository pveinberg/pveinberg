## About Me

I am a specialist in software engineering with long experience in development, analysis, planning and management of IT projects.

For over 15 years I have participated in numerous challenges, as a developer and analyst; but also taking on leadership responsibilities as a Scrum Master or Project Manager. I have an excellent degree of communication in Portuguese and Spanish (native) and I can also read and write without difficulties in English.

I am currently working at a leading telecommunications company in Brazil, performing monitoring and functional analysis activities in a large data ingestion project for a Hadoop environment.

Always looking for new challenges, I'm transitioning into data science; improving my knowledge in Python language (advanced) and developing projects with Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Scikit-Learn libraries, among others.
